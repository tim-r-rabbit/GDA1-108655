## Introduction to Pandas DataFrames â€“ Replicating an article in Markdown

### Pandas.ipynb

In this Jupyter notebook, the website <a href="https://elearn.unigis.at/pluginfile.php/11289/mod_resource/content/23/assignments/Set1/Aufgabe4/PandasIntroduction.html#accessing-data-in-a-dataframe" target="_blank"><ins>**Introduction to Pandas DataFrames**</ins></a> is recreated using Markdown and some code snippets. It demonstrates how the Python library Pandas can be used to access specific data in a DataFrame, such as individual rows, columns or cells. Unlike the website, the example code snippets are not only shown as text but can also be executed, with the results being immediately returned.

Python version 3.11.13 was used.

### Pandas.webp

This is a thematically matching, colored graphic that is integrated into the notebook `Pandas.ipynb`. 

File information:
- Size: 1024 x 1024 pixel
- Resolution: 72 dpi
- Color depth:32 bit

### Pandas.html

This is an HTML version of the final Jupyter notebook. It is located in the subfolder `/dir`, along with a copy of the image `Pandas.webp`, to ensure correct display when this file is opened locally.
